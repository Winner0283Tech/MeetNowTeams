# MeetNowTeams
I think you all know about the Windows 10 Meet Now Flyout, because Skype has been deprecated in May 2025, the Meet Now flyout no longer directly works, but heres an alternative, with Teams!

Heres how to get it on your Windows 11 or 10 install, please note that this has only been tested on Windows 10, if you find out it works on 11 too, it will be good if you comment it, and if not how we can fix it.


NOTE: This project is open-source, but we only ship compiled .exe releases, for terms of stability.
NOTE: If you are an developer, sharing the code is not a good idea, because you will loose access to the files.

Well, i hope you enjoy this project, making it was not that easy, but more features will come on future releases.
If you want to look through the code, you must get access, because a decompiler can make errors usw.
If you have any ideas what to do next, write them in the comments,

NOTE: Nightly betas are mostly unstable, for common users, please use the stable release, because the nightly release is for Devs and Beta testers.

1. Installation
To install it, just download the .exe and run it, if you do not have .NET installed, it will ask you if you want to install it.
Easy, or not?
